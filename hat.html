        <h2>What is Wood</h2>
        <p>A simple explanation about Wood</p>
        <p>
          Wood is a structural tissue found in the stems and roots of trees and
          other woody plants. It is an organic material a natural composite of
          cellulose fibers that are strong in tension and embedded in a matrix
          of lignin that resists compression. Wood is sometimes defined as only
          the secondary xylem in the stems of trees, or it is defined more
          broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the
          roots of trees or shrubs.[citation needed] In a living tree it
          performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to
          stand up by themselves. It also conveys water and nutrients between
          the leaves, other growing tissues, and the roots. Wood may also refer
          to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material
          engineered from wood, or woodchips or fiber.

        <h2>Types of Wood</h2>
        <p>The diffrernt types of wood(soft wood)</p>
        <p>
          Softwood is wood from gymnosperm trees such as pines and spruces.
          Softwoods are not necessarily softer than hardwoods. The hardest
          hardwoods are much harder than any softwood, but in both groups there
          is enormous variation with the range of wood hardness of the two
          groups overlapping.Softwoods are generally most used by the
          construction industry and are also used to produce paper pulp, and
          card products. In many of these applications, there is a constant need
          for density and thickness monitoring and gamma-ray sensors have shown
          good performance in this case.Certain species of softwood are more
          resistant to insect attack from woodworm, as certain insects prefer
          damp hardwood.Examples:pine,conifers,spruce.

        <h2>Types of wood(hardwood)</h2>
        <p>About hard wood</p>
        <p>
          Hardwood is wood from dicot trees. These are usually found in
          broad-leaved temperate and tropical forests.[1] In temperate and
          boreal latitudes they are mostly deciduous, but in tropics and
          subtropics mostly evergreen. Hardwood (which comes from angiosperm
          trees) contrasts with softwood (which is from gymnosperm
          trees).Hardwoods have a more complex structure than softwoods and are
          often much slower growing as a result. The dominant feature separating
          "hardwoods" from softwoods is the presence of pores, or vessels.[4]
          The vessels may show considerable variation in size, shape of
          perforation plates (simple, scalariform, reticulate, foraminate), and
          structure of cell wall, such as spiral thickenings. As the name
          suggests, the wood from these trees is generally harder than that of
          softwoods, but there are significant exceptions. In both groups there
          is an enormous variation in actual wood hardness, with the range in
          density in hardwoods completely including that of softwoods; some
          hardwoods (e.g., balsa) are softer than most softwoods, while yew is
          an example of a hard softwood.
